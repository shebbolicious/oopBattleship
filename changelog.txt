Most of our program was the same when compared to our project plan.
The main difference was that we included far more class functions than we
initially thought we would need (however we were marked with a zero for
data members and functions in the project plan so I won't bother explaining
every change as technically they were all changed).

The other main difference that actually differed from the project plan was that
we added a new class. This was the MainMenu class. We could've coded up the
menu in it's entirety directly in the main, but we thought it would be more
oop like to have a separate class responsible for a main menu's functionalities.
We included a way to: start the game, check the rules, check statistics of past
games, and quit the program.
