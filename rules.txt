This is a spin on the classic 2 player game of battleship.

Each player will first place 6 ships, either vertically or horizontally.
4 of these ships will be regular 2 long ships.
1 ship will be an L-Shaped Ship, 3 long and 2 wide.
1 ship will be a Stealth Ship, 3 long. 
The Stealth Ship acts like a regular ship, with the
only difference being that when it is hit it will show
up as a miss.

There is a regular missile, of which each player gets an
unlimited amount. Grid coordinates are entered to 'shoot' the missile.
A hit will appear as an O and a miss will appear as an X.
There is also 1 row and 1 column missile, which respectively
takes out an entire row or column.
Finally, there is also 1 sonar missile, which acts as a regular
missile but also scans in a 3x3 area of the hit coordinate and reveals
whether there is a ship within that area.
